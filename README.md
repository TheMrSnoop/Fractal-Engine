# Fractal Engine
My attempt at a custom made game engine.
Created in C++ to force myself to learn it, at least to an intermediate level.

# Planned Features
* Uh, 3D rendering
* Has the ability to render a spinning wireframe cube.
* Textures? Maybe?
* Basic Lighting? If I dont give up by then
* Ray Tracing...never happening.
